Welcome to space flyer!!!

Ill start by saying, this is a very important project to me, and i hope you enjoy it!



-----------------FUCTIONALITY------------------
        ~ movement of the carector uses W, A, S, D, movement.
        ~ to shoot, aim anywhere outside of the screen with mouse, and click
        ~ the objective, stay alive and rack up points!


-----------How Its Built!-----------------------

My main draw of inspiration was the shrek game! the movement and setup was very easy to copy and follow along with,

The Math.atan2 function was my best friend in building this project!

Math.atan2() allows me to spawn all of my movemet in a controlled mannor,, allowing me to ain my projectiles, and allowing enemys to constantly move to the center no matter where they are spawned.

Another big helper waw the class setup, alowing me to call on new instances of objectes and easily creatte movement on th screen

-------------------Download-----------------------

There is none!!!

Just hit the link and play!!!


----------Tips for future edits-------------------

Remember, everything is animated in the ANIMATE function.

all objectes are being declared using classes, so if you create more, or make edits be sure to declare it so with a class!

To speed up and slow down things with Atan2. simply multiply any number to its Cos, and Sin values. DO NOT ADD!! you will create a bug!

Every udate function in the classes allows for velocity movement so study it!

Watch closely to the placement of X and Y in your update functions, if placed wrong, your movement will not work!

----------Current Issues---------------------------
End game!

when i end the gane and restart, the enemy respawn time gets absolutely jacked up and i dont know how to fix it.

I welcome anyone to fork and clone, lets fix it together!!


---------BLOCKERS----------------------------------

Man, there where a lot!!! Math.atan2() was definately the biggest blocker i had.. it took me two days to figure out how to finally get everything structored and i almost gave up MANY time.. without atan2() my meteors(balls), would be very boring!!
and i would have NO PROJECTILE!!! sad world :(....

Learning how to be confident with classes was also very hard, because my first version used div and not canvas, which involves a completely different process.

Restart is still a huge blocker, the restart effect my spawn time of all my enemies by speeding it up to a un-realistic amount.

luckily i had friends like Cam, to help me find motivation to de-bugg my code :).

----------Thats All Folks!------------------------

            Enjoy the Game!!!
